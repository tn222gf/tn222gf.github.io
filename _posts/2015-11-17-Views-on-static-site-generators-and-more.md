* What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?
  * Compare to regular CSS
  * Which techniques did you use?
  * Pros and cons?
   
I think that preprocessing CSS is a better way too structure and maintain your CSS-code with partials. Partials is CSS-files containing parts of your CSS-code and can be included into other CSS-files.
   
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is the CSS prepropressor I used to style this site. It allows you to use variables, where you can save for an example color codes and reuse the variable where you want that color.
Sass also provides the ability to use mathematical operators to calculate width, height and  much more.

Pros and cons of preprocessed CSS
