This is my static page on [Github](https://github.com/) generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

As you might already figured out my name is Tobias Nilsson, but what you didn't already know is that I come from a town called Varberg. It's a town on the west-coast of Sweden.

I'm currently studying [Development and Operation of Software](http://lnu.se/utbildning/program/NGUDM) at the [Linnaeus University](http://lnu.se/?l=en) in Kalmar, Sweden. At this writing moment I participate in the courses "Client-based webprogramming" and "Java basic course"
